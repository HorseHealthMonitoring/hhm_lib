Entry     Reason
==================================================
- 8       Specification 3 not completely
          functional.
- 7.5     Chayne Thrash hardware not functional.

Notes: Repo is well prepared. For the future, you
need to build off the libraries in the PIC24 repo
in the event that something is added mid-term.

You can assume that the repo is located at the
same level as your repo. Example:

Folder on my system --- pic24lib_all
                    \-- f16_acorn

Reference these libraries this way from now on.
